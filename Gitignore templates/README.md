## Gitignore 
>`.gitignore` files are helpful in making sure you only get files you care in student repos without the potential of other file types sneaking in

This file is easiest to be in the root when getting started.  Though you can have other `.gitignore` files in subdirectories depending on what needs to get ignored

- The ignore file in the root covers multiple IDEs
- This folder will have various `.gitignore` files

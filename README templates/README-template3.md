# Assignment Title

## Objectives required to complete
Bried description of the lab and general overview of background knowledge required for the lab.  Links to LMS resources or videos or whatever can be posted here does not need to be straight text.

If the lab has multiple parts or you want to help students with chunking you can setup a table to let them know the major parts of the lab.

| Part Number      | Description                               |
| ---------------  | :--------------------------------------:  |
| Part 1           | ZZZ                                       |
| Part 2           | AAA                                       |
| Part 3           | BBB                                       |
| Part 4           | CCC                                       |

## Part 1 - Doing the setup
Break down the major parts into smaller more descriptive parts.

### Objective 0 - ZZZ
Describe the specific steps needed.  An objective of 0 usually means videos to watch or articles to read before starting

### Objective 1 - YYY


## Part 2 - Getting this repo into BLANK
### Objective 1 - Cloning
Description of getting the repo into the respective IDE.

## Part 3 - Completing the tasks
### Objective 1 - ZZZ
Would be putting in here the specific requirements for the assignment

### Objective 2 - AAA
Usually broken apart by whats needed generally and then if other specific methods or classes are needed.  They get their own objective with a description.

One thing I am currently working on is shortening these descriptions to the bare essentials with minor detail as it can get a little overwhelming reading wise on larger projects.

## Part 4 - Completing the quest
### Objective 1 - Pushing
Description on how to submit the code back to GitHub

## README Templates
> This folder will have some README.md template files that could be helpful when setting up new projects

- The files will **not** all be called `README.md`, they will all be unique
- When using one of the unique templates you should rename it to `README.md` inside your own repo

My current go to template for creating new assignments is `README-template3` this is been the go to template for a little over a year now.  There are minor tweaks from where this template began, it started closer to template-2 but has morphed into its current state in the last year.

## Ideas for README
- Use the README to explain the project details
- Outline specific objects you want students to focus on
- You can provide `inline` code hints to students
- Provide entire code block hints with syntax highlighting
```Java
public static void main (String[] args) {

}
```
- You can have students answer questions right inside the README
- You can provide comments back to them inside the README
    - If your comments are more code specific there are better options for that idea of which can be found in the [feedback repo](https://github.com/csa-teachers-help/feedback-ideas) of the organization
